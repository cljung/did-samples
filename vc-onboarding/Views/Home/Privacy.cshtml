<p>When a VC is issued, the only thing that is written to the public blockchain is your did (you can view it in VerifyVC) and your public key. The other claims are only stored securely in the Microsoft Authenticator, and if the claims came from Azure AD B2C, of course they are still there too as that is the master data. </p>
